/* File: FishTank.java
 * -------------------
 * This class represents a fish tank, which is a GCanvas
 * subclass that contains a number of fish that are
 * swimming around. When you create one, first call
 * initialize() to initialize the graphics of the fishtank.
 * Then, call addFish() for each fish you want in the fishtank.
 * Finally, calling moveFish() in an animation loop will
 * make all the fish swim around in the tank.
