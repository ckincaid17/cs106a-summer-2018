 * -----------------
 * This program plays the game Whack-A-Mole.  Every 1/2 second, a mole appears
 * somewhere random on the screen.  If the user clicks a mole, the mole disappears
 * and the user's score, displayed in the upper-left corner in a GLabel, increases by 1.
 * The game plays until the user gets 10 points.
 *
 * This program requires instance variables to store the score label and number so they
 * can be changed in the mouseClicked method.
