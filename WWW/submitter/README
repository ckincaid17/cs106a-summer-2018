Submitter Configuration
=======================

This file describes the contents of config.json, which defines the configuration for the Eclipse
submitter.

min_version
-----------
The minimum allowed submitter version. If the submitter version is less than this, the user will be
told to upgrade their Eclipse software and will not be able to submit.

assignments_url
---------------
URL to a JSON file describing the assignments. The JSON file should be an array of objects, each
object defining one assignment. The object must have the following properties:

* Name: The human-readable name of the assignment, e.g. "Assignment 1: Karel."
* DueDate: The due date in the form YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS (24-hour).
* DirectoryName: The directory in AFS where the assignment is to be stored, e.g. "assignment1."

full_name_cmd
-------------
Shell command (or pipeline) for getting the logged in user's full name. Used
for display only. Leave blank to not display full name.

path
----
The root directory where submissions are stored. Submissions are stored as <path>/<assignment's
directoryName>/<sunet>_<#>.

server
------
An object describing the submission server. Its properties are:

* host: The server hostname.
* port: The port number SSH is running on.
* auth:
    The authentication methods to use. Use empty string to not set. "password,keyboard-interactive"
    should work fine (essentially simulates ssh command). (Not setting this is a bad idea, because
    any machine with Kerberos installed will try to use that and hang waiting for input.)
* key:
    The host key line for the server. To get this value, run "ssh-keyscan -t rsa <host>
    2>/dev/null", where <host> is the server host above (must be exact match). Copy/paste the output
    exactly, and make sure there are no line wraps. Use empty string to disable host key checking (NOT
    RECOMMENDED, because, you know, security).
