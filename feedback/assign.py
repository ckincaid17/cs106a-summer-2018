# Feedback assignment script originally written by Colin Kincaid, Summer 2018

# Input:
#   A list of students' SUNet IDs: sunets.txt
#
# Outputs:
#   A list of lecture days and their assigned SUNets: daily-assignments.txt
#   A list of SUNet hashes and their assigned lectures: hashed-assignments.txt

# Privacy: DO NOT include sunets.txt or daily-assignments.txt in the Git repo.

# This script uses some Python 2 methods. Sorry.
