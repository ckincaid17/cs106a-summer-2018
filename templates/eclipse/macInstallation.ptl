<h2>Installing Eclipse on a Mac</h2>
<p>
	Our version of Eclipse will only work on macOS 10.6 (2009) or higher. If you don't have a supported version of the operating system, you'll need to either upgrade or do your class work on a cluster machine. You can check your version of macOS using <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201260">these instructions</a>.
