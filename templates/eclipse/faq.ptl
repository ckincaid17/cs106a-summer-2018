        Q: Eclipse is showing an error in the Console "Could not save C++ lib configuration file".  Do I need to worry about this?
    </dt>
    <dd>
        A: No.  This error should not affect the running of your programs, and you can ignore it.

        Q: When trying to submit, after logging in with my SUNET ID and password, Eclipse is asking me for a "passcode".  What is this?

    <dd>
        A: The submitter is asking for a two-step authentication passcode, as an additional form of security; please see the updated Eclipse submission instructions above.

        Q: I want to create another file/program within this project.  How do I do this?

    <dd>
        A:
        <ol>
            <li>Right-click on "default package" within the <code>src</code> folder, and go to <strong>New -> Class</strong>.</li>
            <li>
                In the "Name" field, enter the name for your new class (do not include ".java").  Click "Finish".
                <br />
                <img style="width:50%;" src="{{pathToRoot}}images/eclipse/newClass.png" alt="Add New Class" />
                <br />
            </li>
            <li>This will create a new file in your project.  Replace the code in that file with the code you would like to include.</li>

        Q: Help!  I don't see the "running person", submit, import, etc. icons or the "Stanford Menu" in my Eclipse.
    </dt>
    <dd>
        A: This means the Stanford Plugin is not installed; please repeat steps 8 onwards in either the Mac or Windows installation instructions above.

    <dt id="eclipsebroken">
        Q: My Eclipse window doesn't look like the ones in the screenshots or in lecture.  I'm missing some of the panels (e.g. the sidebar showing all my projects).  Help!
    </dt>
    <dd>
        A: Click the "Reset" button in the Stanford Menu to reset to the default view.

        You may also be in Debugger mode instead of Editor mode; use the Stanford Menu to go back to Editor mode.

    <dt id="importError">
        Q: Help!  Eclipse is not letting me import a project.  It gives me a warning at the top that "Some projects cannot be imported".

        <br />
    </dt>
    <dd>
        A: This is because a project with that name is already imported into Eclipse. If you would like to import this project, you must first delete the existing project by right-clicking the project in the sidebar and selecting "Delete".  You can then choose whether to delete the project from your computer as well, or just delete the project from Eclipse.
