<p>Section Handouts and CodeStepByStep lecture practice problems (on the schedule page) are also great ways to practice relevant material.</p>

<h2 id="bluebook">What to Bring</h2>
<p>The exam is on your computer but otherwise closed-book and closed-notes. You should bring:</p>
<ol>
  <li><p>Your laptop and charger</p></li>
  <li><p>The device you use for two-step authentication</p></li>
  <li><p><i>Two double-sided</i> sheets of notes</p></li>
  <li><p>A power strip / extension cord (optional, but recommended if you have access to one)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If you don't have a working laptop let us know AS SOON AS POSSIBLE and we will get you set up with one.</p>


<h2 id="bluebook">Download BlueBook</h2>
<p>
    Like the midterm, the final exam is administered on a digital tool called <i>BlueBook</i>. If you still have BlueBook from the midterm, skip this section. If you have a new laptop, please make sure to download and install BlueBook on your laptop <strong>before the exam</strong>.
    <ul>
      <li>Mac download: <a href="{{pathToRoot}}resources/BlueBook-1.0.0.dmg">Mac</a></li>
      <li>PC download: <a href="{{pathToRoot}}resources/BlueBook Setup 1.0.0.exe">PC</a></li>
      <li>Linux download: <a href="{{pathToRoot}}resources/BlueBook-1.0.0-x86_64.AppImage">Linux</a></li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
  <div class="alert alert-info">
    <p>Note: If you're using a Mac and you get an error saying that the Disk Image is from an unidentified developer, don't panic! Simply open up the <code>Mac-BlueBook-1.0.0.dmg</code> file in your finder, and right click it and select "Open."" The same window will pop up, but this time you'll have a chance to open it anyway. On Windows, if you get a message that says, "Windows protected your PC," you can click on "More info" and then "Run anyway."</p>
  </div>
</p>
<!-- <p>
  A practice exam that can be run on BlueBook can be downloaded above. This exam will be run under timed conditions, and give you an idea of what to expect for the actual exam.
  <br><br>
  Should you run into any technical issues, post on Piazza or shoot the BlueBook team an email at <a href="mailto:brahm@stanford.edu">brahm@stanford.edu</a>.
</p> -->

<!-- Logistics -->
<h2>Logistics</h2>
<p>
	The logistics for the final exam are the same as for the midterm exam (except for an updated syntax reference sheet); please see <a href="{{pathToRoot}}exams/midterm.html#logistics">the midterm logistics</a> section for more information.
</p>


<!-- Material Covered -->
<h2>Material Covered</h2>
<p>The final focuses on material taught since the time of the midterm, including the following concepts listed below.  However, programming is inherently cumulative in that new topics build upon old ones. So you may be asked to solve problems that involve, though not necessarily focus primarily upon, past topics such as strings, int, double, boolean, random numbers, loops, if/else, parameters, return, expressions, variables, constants, file input with Scanner, and so on.  Note that you may be asked to <i>read</i> code (look at a piece of existing code and answer questions about it, such as writing its output) and/or <i>write</i> code (write a piece of code such as a method or short program that solves a given problem).</p>

<ul>
	<li><p><strong>Pass-by-value vs. pass-by-reference:</strong> demonstrate your understanding of objects vs. primitive values (i.e., passing objects, primitives, or arrays as parameters)</p>
	<li><p><strong>GraphicsPrograms:</strong> write Java code to implement a graphics program with certain behavior using Stanford's libraries; this may include drawing shapes such as GRect, GOval, etc., animation, and/or handling mouse events. (This topic was covered before the midterm, but Breakout, which gave practice with this, was due after the midterm)</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Arrays:</strong> interpret/write code that uses a 1D array to solve a problem.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>2D Arrays:</strong> interpret/write code that uses a 2D array (possibly from the pixels of a graphical image, possibly not) to solve a problem.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Collections:</strong> interpret/write code that uses the collections <code>ArrayList</code> and/or <code>HashMap</code> to solve a problem.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Objects and Classes:</strong> interpret/write a class and/or add behavior to an existing class.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Inheritance:</strong> interpret/write a class that extends another class, such as GCanvas.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Interactors:</strong> interpret/write a program that uses GUI components (buttons, labels, text fields) and events to produce a given behavior.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The following concepts will <strong>NOT</strong> be tested on the final:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Karel the Robot</p></li>
	<li><p>Material from the "Life After CS 106A" lectures</p></li>
	<li><p>Graphical shapes not used in lecture/section, such as <code>GArc</code> and <code>GPolygon</code>.</p></li>
	<li><p>converting numbers to/from other bases, such as binary or hexadecimal</p></li>
	<li><p><code>do</code> loops and the <code>continue</code> statement (<code>while</code> loops may be needed, though)</p></li>
	<li><p>the <code>switch</code> statement</p></li>
	<li><p><code>static</code> methods or data (other than <code>static final</code> constants)</p></li>
	<li><p>throwing exceptions with the <code>throw</code> statement</p></li>
	<li><p>any Stanford library functionality not explicitly taught in class, section or homeworks</p></li>
	<li><p>anything else not explicitly covered in lecture, section or homeworks</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Exam Strategies</h2>
