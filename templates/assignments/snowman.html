		<h2>Getting Started</h2>
		<p>
			There is a starter project including all necessary files that you can access using the link below. Once you have the starter code set up, edit <code>Snowman.java</code> so that the assignment actually does what it’s supposed to do (see the assignment handout), which will involve a cycle of coding, testing, and debugging until everything works. The final step is to submit your assignment.
		</p>
		<p>
			This assignment may (optionally) be done in pairs.  <strong>As a reminder, you may only pair up with others with the same section time and location.</strong>
		</p>
		<p><strong>Note:</strong> You may only use <strong>concepts covered up through lecture on Wednesday, July 11</strong> to solve these problems. In particular, you may not use Java concepts you may have learned previously such as private instance variables, arrays, etc.  However, you may use concepts we cover over the next week about graphics for any optional extensions if you would like.  If you have any questions about what is ok/not ok to use, please feel free to ask.

<!-- FAQ -->
<h2>F.A.Q.</h2>
<dl>
	<dt id="applet">
		Q: I am trying to add sounds to my program, but I am getting an error that "AudioClip cannot be resolved to a type", even though I imported acm.util.* as the handout mentions.  What is going on?
	</dt>
	<dd>
		A: You must also <code>import java.applet.*</code>; the handout has been updated to reflect this.
	</dd>
	<dt id="char">
		Q: Is there a way to read a single character of text from the user as a <code>char</code>?
	</dt>
	<dd>
		A: You cannot read a single char.  Instead, read an entire line as a <code>String</code> and do string processing if you would like the first character.
	</dd>
	<dt id="blankguess">
		Q: Do I have to handle the case where the user types a blank line (empty string)?
	</dt>
	<dd>
		A: Yes; treat this as an invalid guess.
	</dd>
	<dt id="promptFile">
		Q: I am using the <code>promptUserForFile</code> method to ask the user for a file name. No matter what file name I type, it never stops re-prompting me to enter the file name again and again. What is wrong?
	</dt>
	<dd>
		A: There can be several reasons for this, but the most common is that you are not running your project in the required way. You must use the black "running person" icon from the toolbar or the "Run" option from the Stanford Menu, not the green "Play" button.  See the Eclipse guide for more information.
	</dd>
	<dt id="random">
		Q: Since the program is so random, how can I possibly match the expected output? How can I use the Output Comparison Tool?
	</dt>
	<dd>
		A: For starters, we suggest that you match the output from the early stages of the program where the secret word is fixed at "PROGRAMMER". If your program works perfectly for those cases, it is very likely that the output is correct for others. For later phases, you don't have to match the randomly chosen words shown in our output logs. But you should have the same general output format as our logs. You can hardcode one of the words shown in the sample output to check if that part of the output is correct.
