		As mentioned in class today during the Honor Code discussion, if you wish to retract any of your assignments for any reason whatsoever, please <strong>send Nick an email</strong> (email at left) saying which assignment(s) you wish to retract.  We will, no questions asked, retract that assignment and give you a 0 for that assignment.  In particular, if there were any Honor Code issues with that assignment, retracting will remove it and we will no longer consider it an Honor Code issue.  Note that you may not retract just parts of assignments, and we do not provide an opportunity to redo that assignment.  The deadline to retract an assignment is <strong>Tuesday, August 15 @ 1PM.</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		If you have any questions about the Honor Code, please see the Honor Code handout under the "Handouts" tab.  Also feel free to come talk to us if you have any questions about the Honor Code, retractions, or anything else.

		Thank you to everyone who has given lecture feedback this quarter! (If you have not received an email from Annie about giving feedback, your assigned lectures have not come up yet). We really appreciate your comments and have been working to incorporate them as much as possible. If, at any point, you would like to provide some quick thoughts about a lecture <strong>besides the ones to which you are assigned</strong>, please feel free. We would really appreciate it!

		We hope you are hard at work on Assignment 2! We have updated the starter project with a change to the console output tool to make it slightly more accurate. Once you download the new starter project, the only change you need to make to your existing project is to copy the "spl.jar" file from the new project's "lib" folder to the current project's "lib" folder, replacing the current "spl.jar" file. The changes to the tool will likely affect very few people, but we would recommend getting the new tool just in case. Happy testing!

	<p>
		Since we did not have time to cover the Eclipse debugger during lecture last Wednesday, we have posted a video and a handout walkthrough to help you get more familiar with debugging using Eclipse. There are a few resources that may come in handy:
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li><strong>Instructions on how to use the Eclipse debugger:</strong> these are in a new section added to the Eclipse page, linked to on the left.</li>
		<li><strong>A "Debugging with Karel" handout:</strong> this is a new handout in the "Handouts" dropdown at the top. This handout walks you through debugging a sample buggy Roomba Karel program using the Eclipse debugger functionality outlined in the above online instructions.</li>
		<li><strong>A video tutorial on using the Eclipse debugger:</strong>
		<br/>
		<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tEVqMKxnkQE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		We <i><strong>highly</strong></i> recommend you read through both of the handouts and/or watch the video to help you as you work on the assignments in this class. Knowing how to use the debugger is a valuable skill that will help you find and fix bugs more quickly. Moreover, if you run into bugs, you should try finding and fixing them yourself first before reaching out for help at the LaIR or office hours; in particular, at helper hours we will ask what you have first tried on your own to fix the issue you are having.
		<br />
		<br />
		Good luck with Assignment 1!

		As a reminder, LaIR helper hours and office hours have begun and are available if you need help on your first assignment, or if you have any questions about course material. The LaIR is in the first floor of Tressider Union. When you arrive, sign up for help at the computer near the back and sit at any of the tables in the area. The LaIR is open <strong>Sun - Wed 7PM-11PM</strong>. Colin's and Annie's office hours are listed in the sidebar to the left.
		<br />
		<br />
		If you visit the LaIR, you will have the option to sign up for two different <strong>queues</strong> to most efficiently get help:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>CLaIR queue:</strong> Sign up for the "Conceptual LaIR" (CLaIR) queue if you have a conceptual question about an assignment or material. Note that <i>you are not allowed to ask questions about your code</i> (e.g. debugging questions) in the CLaIR queue; only conceptual questions will be answered.</li>
		<li><strong>Standard queue:</strong> Sign up for the standard queue if you have a question that does not fit in the above categories, such as a more in-depth debugging question about your code.
