<!-- Debugging -->

		<div class="newsfeedTitle">Debugging with Karel</div>
		<div class="moment">2017063009</div>
	</div>

	<p>
		Since we did not have much time to cover the Eclipse debugger during lecture on Wednesday, we have posted instructions and a handout walkthrough to help you get more familiar with debugging using Eclipse.  There are two new resources that may come in handy:
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li><strong>Instructions on how to use the Eclipse debugger:</strong> these are in a new section added to the Eclipse page, linked to on the left.</li>
		<li><strong>A "Debugging with Karel" handout:</strong> this is a new handout in the "Handouts" dropdown at the top.  This handout walks you through debugging a sample buggy Roomba Karel program using the Eclipse debugger functionality outlined in the above online instructions.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		We <i><strong>highly</strong></i> recommend you read through both of these resources to help you when working on Assignment 1.  Knowing how to use the debugger is a valuable skill that will help you find and fix bugs more quickly.  Moreover, if you run into bugs, you should try finding and fixing them yourself first before reaching out for help at the LaIR or office hours; in particular, at helper hours we will ask what you have first tried on your own to fix the issue you are having.
		<br />
		<br />
		Good luck working on Assignment 1!

		As a reminder, LaIR helper hours and office hours started yesterday, and are available if you need help on your first assignment, or if you have any questions about the material.  The LaIR is in the first floor of Tresidder Union (in the food court area - sign up for help at the computer in the back) and is open <strong>Sun - Wed 7PM-11PM</strong>.  Rishi and Nick's office hours times are listed in the sidebar to the left.
		<br />
		<br />
		If you visit the LaIR, you will have the option to sign up for 3 different <strong>queues</strong> to most efficiently get help:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>2-minute queue:</strong> Sign up for the 2 minute queue if you have a quick 2-minute question a course staff member can help you with.</li>
		<li><strong>CLaIR queue:</strong> Sign up for the "Conceptual LaIR" (CLaIR) queue if you have a conceptual question about an assignment or material.  Note that <i>you are not allowed to ask questions about your code</i> (e.g. debugging questions) in the CLaIR queue; only conceptual questions.</li>
		<li><strong>Standard queue:</strong> Sign up for the standard queue if you have a question that does not fit in the above categories, such as a more in-depth debugging question about your code.
